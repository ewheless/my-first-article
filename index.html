                <p>For many New Yorkers, a bike is their best source of transportation. After the latest death toll of 20 cyclists, many are still improvements to be made to the state of biking in NYC, specifically obstacles in the bike lane.</p>

                <p>“I think it’s getting better all the time, there is growing awareness. But drivers need to be held to account more. I encounter a lot of cars in bike lanes that push us into traffic,” says William Clark, a literary agent who regularly commutes by bike from Brooklyn to his office in Flatiron.</p>

                <p>This is a sentiment echoed by Mitchel Raban, “I have been riding for many years, since 1976. I’ve been doored three times, before it was even known as ‘dooring’. But I also see people using them as a pedestrian strip, and that’s crazy and they know it’s not for that.”</p>

                <p>“I think the fundamental thing is education, people need to care when they drive.”There are times when cyclists have to be on the sidewalk to avoid obstacles.</p>
